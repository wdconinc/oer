Hosting Open Educational Resources on GitHub 

This document describes how to host open educational resources on GitHub. The focus is on course materials that are text-based with a moderate amount of regular image files, such that markdown is an option. This moves the focus away from formatting for specific devices and to a content-centered model (extensions to LaTeX are discussed as well). Different internationalization standards will be discussed as well.

The document goes into the logistics of branches and tags, pull requests, setting up a github.io website, and setting up continuous integration with Travis.
