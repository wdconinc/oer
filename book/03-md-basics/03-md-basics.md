# Writing Documents in Markdown

Whereas the reader may be familiar with mark-up languages such as HTML, [markdown][markdown] removes as much of the technical layout information from the document as possible. Instead of being able to specify the font size and font face explicitly, this is left unspecified.

You may be familiar with the way [Wikipedia][wikipedia] articles are entered (using the [MediaWiki][mediawiki] server software). It is not necessary to specify the fonts used in headers in detail as one would do in Microsoft Word. Instead, all that needs to be specified is that a fragment of text ***is*** a header. On Wikipedia that is done with equal signs.

Markdown takes a very similar approach. For a full description of the markdown syntax, see [the markdown syntax guide][markdown-syntax].
